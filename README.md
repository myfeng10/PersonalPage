# My Personal React Page
 Welcome to the repository for my personal page, a project that began its life as an HTML template and has since evolved into a React application. This site serves as a canvas for my web development journey, showcasing my skills, projects, and interests in a dynamic, interactive format.

## Live Site
The site is currently hosted on Vercel and can be accessed at myfeng10.vercel.app. As a testing ground for new ideas and technologies, the implementation details are still in progress. The site reflects my ongoing learning and experimentation within web development.

## Features
- mReact-Based: Transitioned from static HTML to a dynamic React application, enhancing interactivity and user experience.
- Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless viewing experience across a wide range of devices.
- Future Customizations: Plans to add more personalized features and content to showcase my development skills and interests.
